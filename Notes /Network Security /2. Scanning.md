# **2. ✨Scanning**

> objective: Now that we have basic information on our target, we need more detailed data on the devices in the target network. This will help us in understanding how the network is composed and thus, how to effectively mount our future attacks.

### PPS

??

A word of caution on identified PPS information: a smart and skilled network administrator may deploy anti-enumeration techniques. In addition to this, network administrators may deploy a service (on purpose or inadvertently) to a port that commonly identifies as hosting malware.

→ In order to ensure that one covers all the bases, it is usually best to run multiple scans, using different techniques.

The best option in identifying PPS would be to scan all ports of the remote system, BUT takes a very long time and will surely expose your presence on the network. therefore, it is best to create jobs for specific smaller port ranges.

### The Three way Handshake

In order to understand how to acquire information from networked assets, it is important to understand how TCP/IP establishes communications between two entities.

All TCP based connections begin with a simple exchange of messages called three way handshake, or three message handshake.

The header fields involved in the handshake are:

- Sequence number
- Acknowledgement numbers
- SYN and ACK flags

it’s goot to read the corresponding RFC for communication protocols. If you know how they are designed to function, then the likelihood of your ability to exploit that is greatly increased.

Before exploring scanning tools, we’ll get familiar with wireshark to analyze and understand what happens under the hood.
In order to completely understand how port scanning and host detection works, it's useful to inspect protocols at a low level. 

Command-line packet builder/analyzer tools like Hping or Nping will help us. They allow us to craft packets; therefore, they can be used to detect hosts, run port scans, evade Firewall/lDS and so on.
<br><br><br>
In order to send a very simple TCP SYN packet to a given IP address, we can use the following command:

```python
hping3 -S <IPaddress> -p 80
```

```python
hping3 -S 192.168.0.14 -c 3
hping3 -S 192.168.0.14 -c 3 -p 445
```

port 0 is closed → `RA`  reset and acknowledgement

port 445 is open→ `SA`   SYN and ACK

<br>
## Wireshark

```python
ip.addr=
-- and ( - or - )
tcp.port
tcp.flags.syn==1
tcp contains “elsfoo”
```

hping specifying ports

-2 + `--scan` : udp 

`--scan`  port range

xmas: -FPU → if port doesn’t respond it’s open

## 2.2 Detect Live Hosts And Ports

type of scan (stealthy or aggressive basically) depends on the type ot ptt

### 2.2.1.1 Nmap

used to identify live hosts, open ports and so on.

The following is a recap of the host discovery techniques that Nmap offers.

In the next slides, we will inspect scanning techniques that
allow us to obtain additional information about open,
closed and filtered ports on target machines.
